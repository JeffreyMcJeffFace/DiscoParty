...just some flashing squares in HTML/jQUERY

This is a small demonstration of using jQUERY to start an interval timer. In this timer, the boxes change to a random color very rapidly creating a strobe effect. A single button starts and stops the timer. 

NOTE: the stopping of intervals was tricky! Check it out. Maybe there's an easier way.
